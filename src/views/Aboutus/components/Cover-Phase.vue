Is LawRato a law firm?
    </h1>
    <p class="text-white">
   LawRato is not a law firm. The responses provided to the law-related queries are deliberately bite-sized for easy comprehension and are in no means a full opinion. These should not be taken as absolute and the lawyers posting these responses are only doing so out of goodwill and to provide general public legal assistance. Please note that this does not create a client-lawyer relationship. We inform all clients that the services we provide are not, and should never be, a substitute for legal advice from a lawyer.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white">
        By using LawRato, the lawyers on our platform also do not advertise nor solicit business from potential clients. In fact, what is unique about LawRato is that clients themselves post their queries or come with their cases on our platform looking for lawyers. Ultimately, the client determines who he/she wishes to engage as his/her lawyer.
